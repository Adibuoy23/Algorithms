For example, queuing in life is always in accordance with the first-comer service first, and then the latter service.

        "In C++, the queue template class in <queue> is used. The template requires two parameters, element type and container type. The element type is necessary, and the container type is optional. The default deque is deque, and the list (linked list) type can be used instead.\n",
